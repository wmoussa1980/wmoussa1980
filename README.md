## Assignment 1

The main reason why I am taking this course is because it is one of the required courses for the network administration associate degree. Another reason why I am taking this course is that I think it is essential to learn the fundamentals of the programming languages, including objects and variables, strings, loops, and functions. Especially, Python which is the most widely used programming language for networking and is a critical skill for network engineers. Also, I think that programming is not just about learning the language. It is about problem solving and the skills I will learn in this programming class is applicable in every field and everyday life. Learning to break a problem into parts, consider it from multiple aspects, finding the most efficient solution, error identifying and paying attention to details are good skills to have.

## Assignment 2

The programming language I am going to be using for this class is Python. After doing my research about programming languages I concluded that Python is the best choice of programming language for beginners. There are lots of reasons to learn Python, simply it’s easy to learn, there are many ways to learn it, it is a high-level programming language that has user-friendly syntax. It is known to have fewer lines of code in an easy and simple form. After completing this course, I would like to extend my learning about Python, and I am planning to learn more using w3schools which has a lot of Python tutorials. For the IDE I am going to be using and that I found online is online-Python.com.

## Assignment 3

In this chapter, I learned about data types which is a classification of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and Boolean. Also, this chapter explained the IPO cycle that is defined as a computer procedure for the processing of information. In computation, it is a critical process through which users get the desired outcome. In the program for this chapter, we were able to use the IPO cycle by prompting the user for input and then getting the input, processing the input that we got from the user by using basic arithmetic operations and then displaying the result of the calculation to the user which is the output.
In the assignment for this chapter, I learned how to follow carefully the instruction asked to do the program and I realized that every tiny detail matters to avoid having errors in the program. Also, I learned that a good program plan can save you time when doing a program.


## Assignment 4

In this assignment, I practiced the knowledge I learned in chapter 2 about data types and to create a program plan using a simple pseudocode format that follows the IPO model. The program plan introduces the overall program requirements and then describe the specific input, processing, and output requirements. Also, I learned that consistency is very important when learning a new programming language. The fact is I can’t learn to code by reading about it. The only way to learn is by coding, making a commitment to code every day or four times a week. Like everything in life practicing make you better.


## Assignment 5

In this chapter, I learned about function and practiced my learning by using four functions in our fifth assignment. A function is a group of related statements designed specifically to perform a specific task. Functions make programming easier to break a large problem into smaller parts. The function allows programmers to develop an application in a modular way. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable. Also, I learned about programming style and how is important in programming. Programming style is how you format your code so that it is easy to read and thus easier to understand. Good style includes the use of whitespace, comments, indentation, and naming.
