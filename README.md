## Assignment 1

The main reason why I am taking this course is because it is one of the required courses for the network administration associate degree. Another reason why I am taking this course is that I think it is essential to learn the fundamentals of the programming languages, including objects and variables, strings, loops, and functions. Especially, Python which is the most widely used programming language for networking and is a critical skill for network engineers. Also, I think that programming is not just about learning the language. It is about problem solving and the skills I will learn in this programming class is applicable in every field and everyday life. Learning to break a problem into parts, consider it from multiple aspects, finding the most efficient solution, error identifying and paying attention to details are good skills to have.
