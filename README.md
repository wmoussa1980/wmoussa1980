## Assignment 1

The main reason why I am taking this course is because it is one of the required courses for the network administration associate degree. Another reason why I am taking this course is that I think it is essential to learn the fundamentals of the programming languages, including objects and variables, strings, loops, and functions. Especially, Python which is the most widely used programming language for networking and is a critical skill for network engineers.
