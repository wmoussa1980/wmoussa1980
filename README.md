## Assignment 1

The main reason why I am taking this course is because it is one of the required courses for the network administration associate degree. Another reason why I am taking this course is that I think it is essential to learn the fundamentals of the programming languages, including objects and variables, strings, loops, and functions. Especially, Python which is the most widely used programming language for networking and is a critical skill for network engineers. Also, I think that programming is not just about learning the language. It is about problem solving and the skills I will learn in this programming class is applicable in every field and everyday life. Learning to break a problem into parts, consider it from multiple aspects, finding the most efficient solution, error identifying and paying attention to details are good skills to have.

## Assignment 2

The programming language I am going to be using for this class is Python. After doing my research about programming languages I concluded that Python is the best choice of programming language for beginners. There are lots of reasons to learn Python, simply it’s easy to learn, there are many ways to learn it, it is a high-level programming language that has user-friendly syntax. It is known to have fewer lines of code in an easy and simple form. After completing this course, I would like to extend my learning about Python, and I am planning to learn more using w3schools which has a lot of Python tutorials. For the IDE I am going to be using and that I found online is online-Python.com.

## Assignment 3

In this chapter, I learned about data types which is a classification of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and Boolean. Also, this chapter explained the IPO cycle that is defined as a computer procedure for the processing of information. In computation, it is a critical process through which users get the desired outcome. In the program for this chapter, we were able to use the IPO cycle by prompting the user for input and then getting the input, processing the input that we got from the user by using basic arithmetic operations and then displaying the result of the calculation to the user which is the output.
In the assignment for this chapter, I learned how to follow carefully the instruction asked to do the program and I realized that every tiny detail matters to avoid having errors in the program. Also, I learned that a good program plan can save you time when doing a program.


## Assignment 4

In this assignment, I practiced the knowledge I learned in chapter 2 about data types and to create a program plan using a simple pseudocode format that follows the IPO model. The program plan introduces the overall program requirements and then describe the specific input, processing, and output requirements. Also, I learned that consistency is very important when learning a new programming language. The fact is I can’t learn to code by reading about it. The only way to learn is by coding, making a commitment to code every day or four times a week. Like everything in life practicing make you better.


## Assignment 5

In this chapter, I learned about function and practiced my learning by using four functions in our fifth assignment. A function is a group of related statements designed specifically to perform a specific task. Functions make programming easier to break a large problem into smaller parts. The function allows programmers to develop an application in a modular way. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable. Also, I learned about programming style and how is important in programming. Programming style is how you format your code so that it is easy to read and thus easier to understand. Good style includes the use of whitespace, comments, indentation, and naming.


## Assignment 6

In this session, I used my previous learning from the last session to create multiple functions without the help of Flowgorithm to generate the source code. Also, I learned how important the main function in the program we are working on. The special or uniqueness of main as a function is that this is where the program starts executing code and this is where it usually stops executing code. It is often the first function defined in a program. The main function in Python acts as the point of execution for any program. Defining the main function in Python programming is a necessity to start the execution of the program, it usually controls program execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program.


## Assignment 7

In this chapter we learned about Structured programming is a program written with only the structured programming constructions: sequence, repetition, and selection.  A selection structure, also called an "If-Then-Else" structure allows one set of statements to be executed if a condition is true and another set of actions to be executed if a condition is false. Also, in this chapter we learned about Relational Operators. A relational operator is used to compare two values. Based on the operator and values, the operator returns either True or False. They allow us compare values to determine if one is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another.


## Assignment 8

In this session, we learned about the use of loops in programming languages. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number. In this session we used for loop for our assignment, for loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The for-loop is always used in combination with an iterable object, like a list or a range. The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time.


## Assignment 9

In this session, we continued learning about the use of loops in programming languages. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. In this session we used while loop for our assignment, while Loops are used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed. The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true. In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation.


## Assignment 10

In this session, we continued learning about the use of loops in programming languages. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. In this session we used do while loop for our assignment, do while loop is mainly used in the case where we need to execute the loop at least once. What is unique in do while loops are the fact that the code in the loop block will be executed at least one time. The code in the statement runs one time and then the condition is checked only after the code is executed. So, the code runs once first and then the condition is checked and if the condition checked evaluates to true, the loop continues. Python does not have built-in functionality to explicitly create a do while loop like other languages. Do loops are implemented as while True: and a condition later that includes a break statement.

## Assignment 11

In this chapter we learned about arrays and how they are very useful when working with large amounts of data because arrays can hold a large number of elements. We can use arrays when we want to manipulate data of a certain type.  An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. Arrays help maintain large sets of data under a single variable name to avoid confusion that can occur when using several variables.
